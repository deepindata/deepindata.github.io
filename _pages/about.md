<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>
I've always loved looking at numbers to uncover hidden insights and explain the unknown. I turned this passion into a career where I focused on supply chain analytics for the first 7-ish years, but eventually found myself wanting to work with a more diverse set of data and broaden my technical skills beyond the world of Excel spreadsheets. I enrolled in a data science bootcamp where I learned data science concepts to apply to my own personal projects, and have worked in the analytics and data science world ever since. 
 </p>

<p>I'm hoping to use this blog to continue working on random personal projects based on any interesting data / APIs I find, and as a way to (hopefully) get feedback so I can continue learning along the way. There might be some work-related topics / concepts I work through, but I'd expect it will be more topics I'm passionate about such as music, culture, politics and a whole lot of sports.
